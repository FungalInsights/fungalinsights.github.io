                        Society of Mycology - SBMy.”</p>
                    <p>Once the final article is available online, update the preprint with:</p>
                    <p>“The article was published in Neo Mycologist on https://doi.org/%5bArticle%20DOI%5[date of

                    <p>The journal features essay articles typically spanning 4 to 10 pages. Authors are encouraged to
                        explore
                        underrepresented topics in mycology. Essays should, when possible, reflect diverse perspectives
                        and must
                        be submitted through the standard process. Peer review is required. Extended reviews are also
                        welcome.

                    <p>1. Submissions are checked for format and plagiarism.</p>
                    <p>2. The Editor in Chief evaluates manuscript suitability.</p>
                    <p>3. Suitable papers are assigned to a handling editor.</p>
                    <p>4. The handling editor initiates peer review with at least two external reviewers.</p>
                    <p>5. Reviewers submit their recommendations.</p>
                    <p>6. The handling editor compiles feedback, suggests revisions or decisions, and sends the

                        the Editor in Chief.</p>
                    <p>7. The Editor in Chief makes the final decision and forwards accepted papers to the managing

                        final
                        proofing.</p>
                    <h3>Proofs</h3>
                    <p>Upon acceptance, authors must send the final Word file via email. Proofs are sent as a PDF file
                        and must
                        be reviewed and returned within seven business days. The editorial team will not be responsible
                        for
                        uncorrected errors after this window.</p>
                    <h3>Copyright</h3>
                    <p>Authors are encouraged to share their published articles freely. Data can be reused or
                        republished

                    <h3>Data Availability Policy</h3>
                    <p>Research data are fundamental outputs of the scientific process and must be preserved and made
                        accessible
                        for long-term use. In accordance with international standards in biodiversity research, all data
                        supporting the results published in Neo Mycologist must be deposited in a reliable public
                        repository
                        that provides open access and long-term preservation. Manuscripts will not be considered without
                        a valid
                        link to the deposited data.</p>
                    <p>Authors may use established international repositories (e.g. Dryad, TreeBASE, GenBank, Figshare,
                        GBIF) or
                        any other repository that ensures comparable accessibility and preservation. At submission, a
                        provisional URL must be provided in the Data Availability section. Final acceptance requires the
                        permanent URL of the archived dataset.</p>
                    <p>All archived data must be accompanied by sufficient metadata to allow interpretation,
                        reproduction of
                        results, and full replication of the analyses. The deposited material must be adequate to
                        independently
                        verify all conclusions presented in the paper. Authors may archive additional material, but not
                        less.
                    </p>
                    <p>This policy applies to both primary data generated by the authors and secondary data reused and
                        analyzed
                        in the study, including tabular data, code, images, maps, audio, video, and raw or processed
                        datasets.
                    </p>
                    <p>For sensitive data involving endangered species, protected locations, or culturally or
                        politically
                        sensitive information, authors may anonymize or generalize locality data when possible. In
                        exceptional
                        cases, editors may waive the archiving requirement. Any waiver must be clearly justified in the
                        Data

                    <p>Researchers are expected to adhere to high standards of ethical conduct when publishing and
                        sharing
                        scientific knowledge—even when doing so may not align with personal or professional gain.
                        Publishing
                        scientific work in reputable journals is a crucial component of disseminating research.
                        Therefore,
                        editors, authors, and reviewers involved with <em>Neo Mycologist</em>, must maintain integrity
