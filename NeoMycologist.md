# *Neo Mycologist*

It is with great enthusiasm that the international scientific community anticipates the launch, in 2026, of *Neo Mycologist* – a new and vibrant scientific journal dedicated to the publication of innovative and disruptive studies in the fascinating Fungi-like organisms.

*Neo Mycologist* arises from the need for an international forum that not only honors the foundations of mycology but also embraces the cutting edge of modern methodologies and interdisciplinary frontiers. Our goal is to be the premier platform for research that challenges the *status quo* and redefines our understanding of fungal biology and their planetary importance.

*Neo Mycologist* is an electronic, peer-reviewed journal edited by INCT-Fungi/CNPq and supported by UFRN, dedicated to publishing high-quality research in fungal biology. This open-access platform serves as a resource for the global mycology community, ensuring broad dissemination and visibility. Authors retain full copyright of their work.

**Key Features:**

- Peer-reviewed research articles and monographs;

- Fully open-access publication model;

- Rapid editorial and publication process;

- Detailed policy on publication fees available in the submission guidelines;

- Thematic and special issue volumes are featured periodically.

The submission of manuscripts for publications in *Neo Mycologist* is made EXCLUSIVELY through the site [submission page](https://www.mycosphere.org/submissions.php) (the link will be available soon!) and must be prepared in accordance with the instructions.

## A Comprehensive and Forward-Looking Scope

### Scope

*Neo Mycologist* is an international journal dedicated to publishing high-quality research across all areas of mycology, integrating classical and modern approaches. The journal welcomes studies on fungal diversity, systematics, evolution, genetics, ecology, physiology, biotechnology, bioinformatics, medical and plant-associated fungi.

We particularly encourage manuscripts that combine morphological, molecular, ecological, and evolutionary perspectives, including descriptions of new taxa, phylogenetic and genomic analyses, fungal interactions, applied mycology, and emerging frontiers in fungal research.

*Neo Mycologist* aims to serve as a platform for rigorous, forward-looking studies that advance our understanding of fungi and their roles in natural, agricultural, and clinical systems.

## Submissions

### General Policy

Neo Mycologist invites submissions across a range of formats, including review articles (e.g. bibliometric analysis), original research papers, methodological studies, ecological and biotechnological studies, taxonomic contributions (e.g., monographs, reviews, species descriptions), and fungal-related checklists. All submissions must be written in English, the journal's official language.

### Plagiarism

Authors are advised to utilize plagiarism-checking tools before submission. Manuscripts with plagiarism levels over 30% will be automatically rejected.

### Preprints

*Neo Mycologist* as an open-source journal allows the submission of manuscripts that have previously appeared as preprints. These are not considered duplicate publications. Preprints receive a DOI and are citable. When submitting a preprinted manuscript, include its link in the Supplementary Materials, following the *Neo Mycologist* formatting template.  

After acceptance, the preprint must include the following statement:  
“This article has been accepted for publication in *Neo Mycologist*, published by the Brazilian Society of Mycology - SBMy.”  
Once the final article is available online, update the preprint with:  
“The article was published in Neo Mycologist on [date of publication], available online: [https://doi.org/[Article DOI]](https://doi.org/%5bArticle%20DOI%5d).”

### Neo Mycologist Notes

The journal features essay articles typically spanning 4 to 10 pages. Authors are encouraged to explore underrepresented topics in mycology. Essays should, when possible, reflect diverse perspectives and must be submitted through the standard process. Peer review is required. Extended reviews are also welcome.

## Manuscript Preparation – General Guidelines

To ensure efficient processing, manuscripts should be scientifically robust and correctly formatted. Authors should use the ‘Template_NeoMycology_2025’ or model their layout after recent journal articles.

- Download template: [Click here](https://www.mycosphere.org/Template_Mycosphere_2025.doc) (update link if template name changes)

- Use Times New Roman, 12 pt, single-spaced for all text and figure legends.

- Italicize Latin to all taxonomic rankings.

- Disable hyphenation and avoid any special formatting.

- Ensure page numbers appear at the bottom right of each page.

For new taxonomic names, register them in the appropriate databases and obtain MycoBank via [http://www.mycobank.org/  
](http://www.facesoffungi.org/)If phylogenetic trees are included, FASTA format alignment files must accompany the manuscript.

3. Suitable papers are assigned to a handling editor.

4. The handling editor initiates peer review with at least two external reviewers.

5. Reviewers submit their recommendations.

6. The handling editor compiles feedback, suggests revisions or decisions, and sends the manuscript to the EIC.

7. The EIC makes the final decision and forwards accepted papers to the managing editor for final proofing.

### Proofs

Upon acceptance, authors must send the final Word file via email. Proofs are sent as a PDF file and must be reviewed and returned within seven business days. The editorial team will not be responsible for uncorrected errors after this window.

### Copyright

Authors are encouraged to share their published articles freely. Data can be reused or republished elsewhere without requesting permission. The journal operates under a Creative Commons license.

### Data Availability Policy

Research data are fundamental outputs of the scientific process and must be preserved and made accessible for long-term use. In accordance with international standards in biodiversity research, all data supporting the results published in Neo Mycologist must be deposited in a reliable public repository that provides open access and long-term preservation. Manuscripts will not be considered without a valid link to the deposited data.

Authors may use established international repositories (e.g. Dryad, TreeBASE, GenBank, Figshare, GBIF) or any other repository that ensures comparable accessibility and preservation. At submission, a provisional URL must be provided in the Data Availability section. Final acceptance requires the permanent URL of the archived dataset.

All archived data must be accompanied by sufficient metadata to allow interpretation, reproduction of results, and full replication of the analyses. The deposited material must be adequate to independently verify all conclusions presented in the paper. Authors may archive additional material, but not less.

This policy applies to both primary data generated by the authors and secondary data reused and analyzed in the study, including tabular data, code, images, maps, audio, video, and raw or processed datasets.

For sensitive data involving endangered species, protected locations, or culturally or politically sensitive information, authors may anonymize or generalize locality data when possible. In exceptional cases, editors may waive the archiving requirement. Any waiver must be clearly justified in the Data Availability Statement.
